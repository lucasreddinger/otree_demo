    <p>
        This app demonstrates how to have a waiting page that just waits for certain people to arrive before proceeding.
        You can make it any subset of participants: for example, just the participants you marked as being online currently,
        or just those who gave a specific answer to a question.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this demo, the players were randomly selected as: {{ session.wait_for_ids }}.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are player {{ player.id_in_subsession }}, so you
        {{ if player.selected_for_waitpage }}
            must wait on
        {{ else}}
            can skip
        {{ endif }}
        the following wait page.
    </p>

    <p>Click next.</p>
    {{ next_button }}
